Calculate your expected running pace for a non-standard length interval.

It is not always possible to have access to a running track for interval training. You may have access to a public path or park that is suitable for speed work, but it may be of a non-standard length e.g. 650m. In this situation, you can use this tool to determine your expected pace for the non-standard length.
